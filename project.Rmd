Here are the guidelines for the course's concluding project.
The project is based on the [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) competition at Kaggle.
You are required to submit a prediction to Kaggle, and a report on the process to me.

# Dates
Teaming up: no later than _27.4.2015_.
Submit prediction to Kaggle: _29.5.2015_.
Submit report to Jonathan : _26.6.2015_.

Recommended time-table:

1. During the Passover vacation, download the data. Make sure you can load it and practice `dplyr` and `lubridate` on it.
2. After Passover, find your partner and notify me.
3. Keep revisiting the data as we progress and study new techniques. Don't leave everything to submission date.
