Here are the guidelines for the course's concluding project.
The project is based on [Kaggle's]() competitions.
You will be required to pick one of 5 competitions, submit an entry, and report the process.

# Dates
Teaming up: no later than 27.4.2015
Submission data: no later than 26.6.2015

Recommended time-table:

1. During the passover vacation, go over the different competitions. Download the data. Make sure you can load it. 
2. After passover, find your partner and project and notify me.
3. Don't wait until the last minute! [This](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) is an easy reference to start reading for yourself. [This](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) is a more advanced reference. Once you picked your project, I can point to the appropriate chapters.
