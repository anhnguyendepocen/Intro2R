In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course--likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures--the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, one of the book's unifying themes that mainly entails the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation.},

	shorttitle = {Statistical theory},
	abstract = {"Designed for a one-semester advanced undergraduate or graduate course, Statistical Theory: A Concise Introduction clearly explains the underlying ideas and principles of major statistical concepts, including parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, asymptotic analysis, Bayesian inference, and elements of decision theory. It introduces these topics on a clear intuitive level using illustrative examples in addition to the formal definitions, theorems, and proofs. Based on the authors' lecture notes, this student-oriented, self-contained book maintains a proper balance between the clarity and rigor of exposition. In a few cases, the authors present a 'sketched' version of a proof, explaining its main ideas rather than giving detailed technical mathematical and probabilistic arguments. Chapters and sections marked by asterisks contain more advanced topics and may be omitted. A special chapter on linear models shows how the main theoretical concepts can be applied to the well-known and frequently used statistical tool of linear regression.Requiring no heavy calculus, simple questions throughout the text help students check their understanding of the material. Each chapter also includes a set of exercises that range in level of difficulty"-- "Preface This book is intended as a textbook for a one-term course in statistical theory for advanced undergraduates in statistics, mathematics or other related fields although at least parts of it may be useful for graduates as well. Although there exist many good books on the topic, having taught a one-term Statistical Theory course during the years we felt that it is somewhat hard to recommend a particular one as a proper textbook to undergraduate students in statistics. Some of the existing textbooks with a primary focus on rigorous formalism, in our view, do not explain sufficiently clearly the underlying ideas and principles of the main statistical concepts, and are more suitable for graduates. Some others are "all-inclusive" textbooks that include a variety of topics in statistics that make them "too heavy" for a one-term course in statistical theory. Our main motivation was to propose a more "student-oriented" self-contained textbook designed for a one-term course on statistical theory that would introduce basic statistical concepts first on a clear intuitive level with illustrative examples in addition to the (necessary!) formal definitions, theorems and proofs. It is based on our lecture notes. We tried to keep a proper balance between the clarity and rigorousness of exposition. In a few cases we preferred to present a "sketched" version of a proof explaining its main ideas or even to give it up at all rather then to follow detailed technical mathematical and probabilistic arguments. The interested reader can complete those proofs from other existing books on mathematical statistics (see the bibliography)"--},

	title = {The {Elements} of {Statistical} {Learning}},
	isbn = {0387952845},
	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry.

The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit.

FROM THE REVIEWS:

TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

The corresponding results for polynomial splines are a special case of the general solution. Then, we show how these ideas can be directly extended to the very general L-spline smoothing.},

	abstract = {We predict the onset of personal bankruptcy using least squares regression. Although well publicized, only 2,244 bankruptcies occur in our dataset of 2.9 million months of credit-card activity. We use stepwise selection to find predictors of these from a mix of payment history, debt load, demographics, and their interactions. This combination of rare responses and over 67,000 possible predictors leads to a challenging modeling question: How does one separate coincidental from useful predictors? We show that three modifications turn stepwise regression into an effective methodology for predicting bankruptcy. Our version of stepwise regression (1) organizes calculations to accommodate interactions, (2) exploits modern decision theoretic criteria to choose predictors, and (3) conservatively estimates p-values to handle sparse data and a binary response. Omitting any one of these leads to poor performance. A final step in our procedure calibrates regression predictions. With these modifications, stepwise regression predicts bankruptcy as well as, if not better than, recently developed data-mining tools. When sorted, the largest 14,000 resulting predictions hold 1,000 of the 1,800 bankruptcies hidden in a validation sample of 2.3 million observations. If the cost of missing a bankruptcy is 200 times that of a false positive, our predictions incur less than 2/3 of the costs of classification errors produced by the tree-based classifier C4.5.},
