\label{sec:unsupervised}

Unlike Supervised Learning, in Unsupervised Learning there is no outcome variable. 
There is thus no notion of ``right'' and ``wrong''. 
We merely want to learn the joint distribution of the data, $x \in \featureS$, and represent it in some way we can understand. 
Well, maybe ``merely'' is not the right word, as learning the joint distribution of the data means that instead of learning the relation between a set $x$ and another, $y$, we now try to learn the relation between all pairs of variables in $x$, which is clearly more challenging. 

Describing the data via it's joint distribution is the pinnacle, but would require many samples if $x$ has a high dimension (by high we mean $p>3$!). For higher dimensions we need to set more modest goals, which vary according to the purpose of the analysis.

The different goals of unsupervised learning can be
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Density Estimation}: Estimate $\dist(x)$.
\item \textbf{High density regions}: Find feature combinations which tend to concentrate, hopefully, because the belong to homogenous and interpretable subgroups.
\item \textbf{Low dimensional representation}: Find a low dimensional representation of the joint distribution. This allows the learning from realistic sample sizes, and analysis by, e.g., interpretable parameters and visualization.
Since this also serves in supervised learning, it is discussed with more generality in Appendix~\ref{apx:dim_reduce}.
\item \textbf{Cluster}: Assign observation to homogenous groups. In particular, the particular features of an observation are no longer of interest, once it has been assigned to a cluster.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{remark}[Relation to Supervised Classification]
Learning the joint data distribution, i.e., density estimation, is not only a goal for itself, but can serve for classification. 
The full data generating distribution, in the context of \emph{supervised} learning is called the \emph{generative model}.\marginnote{Generative Model}
See Appendix \ref{apx:generative_concept} for the usage of the estimated generative model for classification.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}[Unsupervised Learning in the ERM framework]
Many unsupervised learning problems, can be cast in the ERM framework.
This has not been done in the current version of our text due to both time constraints, and compatibility with the referenced literature.
\end{remark}








\section{Cluster Analysis}
\label{sec:cluster_analysis}

In cluster analysis, we aim at assigning observations to (hopefully) homogenous and meaningful clusters. 

Groups identified are called \emph{clusters}, so that these methods are known as \emph{cluster analysis}, or \emph{data segmentation} methods.

Cluster analysis is typically easier than learning a joint distribution (\S\ref{sec:density_estimation}) or even detecting high density regions (\S\ref{sec:high_density}). 
We will see that for cluster analysis, we don't need the actual features $X$; as it will turn out, many methods only require some notion of distance between the points, and not their actual features. 
For this reason, clustering is intimately related to graph, or \emph{network}\footnote{A graph describes a yes/no relation. A network is a weighted graph, which not only describes the existence of a relation, but also its strength.} partitioning problems.



\subsection{K-Means Clustering}
\label{sec:kmeans}
The goal behind K-means clustering is finding a representative point for each of K clusters, and assign each (unlabelled) data point to one of these clusters. As each cluster has a representative point, this is also a \emph{prototype method}.\marginnote{Prototype Methods}.
The clusters are defined so that they minimize the average distance between all points to the center of the cluster.

K-means clustering requires the raw features $X$ as inputs, and not only a similarity graph. This is evident when examining Algorithm~\ref{algo:kmeans}.

In K-means, the clusters are first defined, and then similarities computed. This is thus a \emph{top-down} method.\marginnote{Top Down Clustering}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{K-Means}
\label{algo:kmeans}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State Choose the number of clusters $K$.
\State Arbitrarily assign points to clusters.
\While {Clusters keep changing}
	\State Compute the cluster centers as the average of their points.
	\State Assign each point to its closest cluster center (in Euclidean distance).
\EndWhile
\State \Return Cluster assignments and means.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}





\subsection{K-Medoids Clustering}
\label{sec:k_medoids}


If a Euclidean distance is inappropriate for a particular $\featureS$, or that robustness to corrupt observations is required, or that we wish to constrain the cluster centers to be actual observations, then the \emph{K-Medoids} algorithm is an adaptation of K-means that allows this.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{K-Medoids}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State Choose a similarity metric $\similarity(x_i,x_j)$.
\State Choose the number of clusters $K$.
\State Arbitrarily assign points to clusters.
\While {Clusters keep changing}
	\State Within each cluster, set the center as the data point that minimizes the sum of distances to other points in the cluster.
	\State Assign each point to its closest cluster center (in $\similarity(x_i,x_j)$ distance).
\EndWhile
\State \Return Cluster assignments and centers.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


See Section 14.3.10 in \cite{hastie_elements_2003}.








\subsection{Hierarchical Clustering}
\label{sec:hierarchical}

These algorithms take similarity (dissimilarity) graphs as inputs.
Hierarchical clustering is a class of greedy graph-partitioning algorithms. 
Being hierarchical by design, they have the attractive property that the evolution of the clustering can be presented with a dendogram (\S\ref{sec:dendogram}).  
Unlike k-means, the method is the algorithm itself and cannot be cast as an optimization (ERM) problem.
Also, it does not require an a-priori choice of the number of cluster.

For more on hierarchical clustering see Section 14.3.12 in \cite{hastie_elements_2003}.

Two main sub-classes of algorithms can be identified: \emph{agglomerative}, and \emph{divisive}.
\subsubsection{Agglomerative Clustering}
Agglomerative clustering algorithms are bottom-up algorithm which build clusters by joining smaller clusters. 
To decide which clusters are joined at each iteration some measure of closeness between clusters is required. 
\begin{description}
\item[Single Linkage] Cluster distance is defined by the distance between the two \textbf{closest} members.
\item[Complete Linkage] Cluster distance is defined by the distance between the two \textbf{farthest} members.
\item[Group Average] Cluster distance is defined by the \textbf{average} distance between members.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Divisive Clustering}
Divisive clustering algorithms are top-down algorithm which build clusters by splitting larger clusters. 
There are several way to divide clusters. All amount to considering some homogeneity measure on the set of all possible divisions. As this is typically computationally intense, greedy algorithms can be employed.









\subsection{Spectral Clustering}
\label{sec:spectral_clustering}
[TODO]





\subsection{Self Organizing Maps (SOM)}
\label{sec:som}
SOMs, also known as \emph{Kohonen maps}, and \emph{self organizing feature maps} (SOFM), and \emph{constrained topological map}. 
They are a dimensionality reduction method, which driven by the quality of clustering.
The method requires the original features $X$, and not only a similarity graph. \marginnote{Kohonen Map}
As such, they can be seen as the marriage of K-means clustering (\S\ref{sec:kmeans}) with dimensionality reduction (\S\ref{sec:dim_reduce_linear}).



\paragraph{Mathematics of SOMs}
[TODO]

For more on SOMs see Section 14.4 in \cite{hastie_elements_2003}. 









\section{High Density Regions}
\label{sec:high_density}

When data is high dimensional a full blown density estimation may be statistically and computationally impractical.
We can still, however, aim at detecting regions in $\featureS$ with high probability (which would have been trivial have we had a density estimate).

Once high density regions have been detected, they could be assigned to clusters. Then again, assigning to clusters is typically an easier problem which can be solved directly (see \S\ref{sec:cluster_analysis}).



\subsection{Association Rules}
\label{sec:association}
Association rules, or \emph{market basket analysis}, or \emph{affinity analysis}, can be seen as approximating the joint distribution with a region-wise constant function (Eq.~\ref{eq:decision_list}).\marginnote{Market Basket Analysis}
Put differently, we want to capture high density regions of the joint distribution of $x$ with by approximating it with a decision-list (not tree).
Learning a decision-list is a computationally impractical problem in general. Association rules are thus typically learned over binary feature spaces $\featureS$, using heuristic optimization schemes.

This type of problems typically occurs in sales analysis, where vendors seek for combinations of products that tend to sell jointly (so that can design the store better, or discount product bundles).

The \emph{Aprioiri} algorithm \cite{agraval_fast_1994}, is an example of such a heuristic search for high density combinations.\marginnote{Apriori Algorithm}






% % % Density Estimation % % % % 
\section{Density Estimation}
\label{sec:density_estimation}

We now aim at the possibly hardest target in unsupervised learning- estimating $\dist(x)$.
As previously stated, learning $\dist$ is of interest for itself, but can also serve for classification (\S\ref{sec:generative}), for detecting high density regions (\S\ref{sec:high_density}), and for clustering (\S\ref{sec:cluster_analysis}).




\subsection{Parametric Density Estimation}
If a parametric generative model can be assumed, this collapses to the parameter estimation problem in the classical statistical literature (\S\ref{sec:estimation}). Maximum Likelihood estimation being a particularly attractive approach, but certainly not the only one.
If a parametric model cannot be assumed, we fall into the realm of non-parametric methods. 
As we saw for supervised learning, these typically rely on pooling information from neighbourhoods of $\featureS$.



\subsection{Kernel Density Estimation}
\label{sec:kernel_density}

Much like the Kernel Regression regression, a \naive estimator is the moving average.
A natural generalization, in the spirit of the Nadaraya-Watson smoother (Eq.(\ref{eq:nadaraya_watson})) is the \emph{Parzen} estimate:\marginnote{Parzen Estimate}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:parzen}
	\estim{\pdf}(x):=\frac{1}{n \lambda} \sum_{i=1}^n \kernel_\lambda(x,x_i).
\end{align}

\begin{remark}
If you have been convinced by the use of KNN (\S\ref{sec:knn}) for regression (or classification), there is no reason not to use it for density estimation. It will keep offering the same pros and cons as in KNN regression (or classification).
\end{remark}

As previously stated, these methods may fail when $x$ are high dimensional. We thus recur to other methods.



\subsection{Graphical Models}
\label{sec:graphical_models}

Graphical models are graphs that represent joint distributions\footnote{Unlike \emph{graph data}, where the graph is the data itself, and not a distribution.}
For our purposes, we discuss only \emph{undirected graphical models}, also known as \emph{Markov random fields}, or \emph{Markov networks}.
The reason these models are interesting, and particularly for the purpose of density estimation, is that missing edges in a graphical model represents conditional independencies between random variables. 
If the graph structure can be assumed, and hopefully has many missing edges, then the dimension of the density estimation problem can be reduced. 

In the cases the graph structure cannot be assumed, then our goal becomes the learning of the graph structure from the data. I.e., learning the (conditional) independencies between the variables. For a multivariate Gaussian distribution, this amounts to estimating the covariance, while imposing some sparsity assumption. 
An important fact in this regard is that in the multivariate Gaussian case, missing edges in the graphical model, mean zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix. This fact sets the bridge between learning a the structure of a graphical model, and (sparse) covariance estimation.

\begin{remark}[Restricted Bolzmann Machine]
In this context it is also worth mentioning the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), which is a multivariate distribution with particular class of graphical structure, motivated from Neural Networks. \marginnote{Restricted Bolzmann Machine}
\end{remark}


For a more detailed review of Graphical Models, see Chapters 17 and 20 in \cite{wasserman_all_2004}. 















\section{Linear-Space Embeddings}
\label{sec:dim_reduce_linear}


The idea of ERM and Inductive Bias also applies to unsupervised learning.
If $\hyp(x)$ is low dimensional representation of $x$, mapping it to a ``simple'' manifold $\manifold$, we would seek some $\hyp$ that does not incur too much loss, on average. I.e., we seek to minimize $\risk(\hyp)$.

As usual, we do not have access to the data generating process of $x$, so we typically content ourselves with the empirical risk minimization.
In the context of unsupervised learing, the empirical risk is known as the \emph{reconstruction error}.\marginnote{Reconstruction Error}

The building blocks of a supervised learning problem are: 
(i) the loss function $\loss$,
(ii) the hypothesis class $\hypclass$, 
(iii) a regularization level, and
(iv) the optimization scheme.
In unsupervised learning, we have similar building blocks. We still have some loss function, regularized or not, penalizing for the poor reconstruction of the data. We can still solve an ERM problem, or replace the optimization by some other learning algorithm. The main difference is in that instead of some low dimensional mapping $\hyp:x \mapsto \estim{y}$, we learn a mapping  $\hyp:x \mapsto \estim{x}$.


For a general discussion of the idea of dimensionality reduction see Appendix~\ref{apx:dim_reduce}.

\begin{remark}[Interpreting ``Linear'']
\label{remark:linear}
	Two interpretations of ``linear'' can be found in the literature. It may refer to the nature of the low dimensional space approximating the data, or to the nature of the embedding operation. In this text, we use the first interpretation, meaning that $\manifold$ is a linear subspace, even if the embedding operation is non linear.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}[Dimensionality Reduction and Latent Space Generative Models]
 The methods in this section allow us to approximate the data in a lower dimension. 
 They take $X$ as inputs, and return an approximated $X$. 
 If we seek to interpret the parameters/coordinates of our data in its low dimensional representation we need to be cautious as it is probably not unique. For this purpose, see the Latent Space Generative Models Section (\S\ref{sec:latent_space}).
\end{remark}




\subsection{Principal Components Analysis (PCA)}
\label{sec:pca}

PCA is such a basic technique, it has been rediscovered and renamed independently in many fields. 
It can be found under the names of \emph{discrete Karhunen–Loève Transform; Hotteling Transform; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD); Eckart–Young Theorem; Schmidt–Mirsky Theorem;  Empirical Orthogonal Functions; Empirical Eigenfunction Decomposition;  Empirical Component Analysis;  Quasi-Harmonic Modes;  Spectral Decomposition;  Empirical Modal Analysis;} and possibly more\footnote{Wikipedia: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis} }.
The many names are quite interesting as they offer an insight into the different problems that led to its (re)discovery.

Starting with an example, consider human height and weight data. 
While clearly two dimensional data, you don't really need both to understand how ``big'' are the people in the data. 
This is because, height and weight vary mostly along a single dimension, which can be interpreted as the ``bigness'' of an individual. 
This is why, physicians use the Body Mass Index (BMI) as an indicator of size, instead of a two-dimensional measurement.
Assume you now wish to give each individual a size score, that is a linear combination of height and weight: PCA does just that. It returns the linear combination that has the most variability, i.e., the combination which best distinguishes between individuals. 



\paragraph{Terminology}
PCA has received much attention. As such, it has rich underlying theory and terminology.
Here are some terms needed to understand PCA outputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Principal Components}:  The linear combinations of the features, which best separate between observations. In our example- the ``bigness'' index of each individual. The first components captures the most variance, the second components, the second most-variance, etc. In terms of $\manifold$, the principal components are an orthogonal basis for $\manifold$.
\item \textbf{Scores}: Synonymous to Principal Components.
\item \textbf{Loadings}: The weights of each data point in each principal component. In our example, the importance of the height and weight in constructing the ``bigness'' score.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Intuition}
Notice we have currently offered two motivations for PCA: 
(i) Find linear combinations that best distinguish between observations, i.e., maximize variance. 
(ii) Find the linear subspace the bets approximates the data.
The reason these two problems are equivalent, is due to the use of the squares error.
Informally speaking, the data has some total variance. This variance can be decomposed into the part captured in $\manifold$, and the part not captured\footnote{Analogous to $SST=SSR+SSE$ in linear regression.}. 
Since the variance in the data consists of sums of squares, minimizing the distance from $X$ to $\manifold$, is the same as maximizing the variance of $X \project \manifold$, since their sum is fixed.

Historically, the derivation of PCA as a linear space embedding, (i), is due to \cite{pearson_liii._1901}. 
The variance maximizing combinations, (ii), is due to \cite{hotelling_analysis_1933}.


\paragraph{Mathematics of PCA}

[TODO: discuss the problems arising from the different motivations]

PCA seeks to represent $x$ in the simplest manifold possible: a linear subspace. Thus, $\manifold$ is simply a rank $\rank$ linear subspace in $\mathbb{R}^p$.
A low dimensional representation of the points in the data consists of decoding their low dimensional encoding. 
Since we are dealing with linear spaces, encoding and decoding can be represented with matrices. 
We thus denote the encoding operator by $\encode:\featureS \mapsto \reals^\rank$, a $\rank \times p$ matrix.
We also denote the decoding operator by $\decode:\reals^\rank \mapsto \featureS$ , a $p \times \rank$ matrix. 
Our predictor function ($\hyp$) in this case is $\hyp(x_i)=\decode\encode x_i$.
 
The ERM problem:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PCA}
	\argmin{\decode,\encode}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_i (x_i-\decode\encode x_i)^2} .
\end{align}

Without proof, it turns out that Eq.(\ref{eq:PCA}) has a closed form solution. 
This solution is typically presented using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of $X$ we now define.\marginnote{SVD}
\begin{definition}[SVD]
Any $n \times p$ matrix $X$, can be decomposed into $X=UDV'$ where 
$U$ is an $n \times p$ orthogonal matrix ($U'U=I_p$); 
$D$ is a $p \times p$ diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \dots \geq d_p$;
$V$ is a $p \times p$ orthogonal matrix ($V'V=I_p$).
\end{definition}

The solution to Eq.(\ref{eq:PCA}) is 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PCA_solution}
	\estim{\encode} =& V_\rank' \\
	\estim{\decode} =& V_\rank,
\end{align}
where $V_\rank$ are the first $\rank$ columns of $V$ in the Singular Value Decomposition of $X$.




\begin{remark}[PCA as a Graph Method]
\label{remark:pca_as_graph}
While the PCA problem is cast in the terms of $X$, its solution only depends on the correlations between individuals $XX'$.
This has several implications:
(i) All data sets with the same correlations, will lead to the same solution, irrespective of the precise features $X$. It is also quite magical that we can linearly approximate the data just be knowing the similarities, and without the features $X$ themselves.
(ii) Seeing the correlations as a similarity graph $\similaritys$, we can take inspiration from the PCA solution and apply it to arbitrary similarity graphs. This is precisely the idea underlying Spectral Clustering (\S\ref{sec:spectral_clustering}) and kPCA (\S\ref{sec:kpca}).
\end{remark}




\subsection{Sparse Principal Component Analysis (sPCA)}
\label{sec:spca}

When analyzing the PCA results, we often with to understand which features contribute to which component. 
This is much easier when the loadings, $\loadings$ are sparse, i.e., include many zeroes. 
This is the purpose of sPCA. 
We will not go into the technical detail, but merely state that sPCA performs this, \`a-la LASSO style, by means of $l_1$ regularization.



\subsection{Self Organizing Maps (SOM)}
SOMs, already discussed in Section~\ref{sec:som}, are a linear-subspace dimensionality reduction method, aimed at good clustering. 


\subsection{Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)}
\label{sec:mds}

MDS aims at representing a network\footnote{The term Graph is typically used in this context instead of Network. But a graph allows only yes/no relations, while a network, which is a weighted graph, allows a continous measure of similarity (or dissimilarity). It is thus more appropriate.} of distances (or similarities) between observations, by embedding the observations in a $\rank$ dimensional \emph{linear} subspace, while preserving the original distances.
The network may be obtained by computing some similarity (or dissimilarity) measure with the raw features $X$, or simply because the data itself is a network (social, communication, etc.).

Since MDS mainly serves for visualizing data, it is most natural to use $\rank=2$. 
The embedding will distort the original distances (or\dots), and may even change the ordering of the observations. The good news is that it is easier to visualize \andor cluster them in their new simplified representation. 

If the input of MDS is the empirical covariance similarity network, then MDS with ``classical scaling'' (see below) returns the exact same solution as PCA.

The embedding is merely the assigning of each point to a location in some lower dimensional linear space $\manifold$. 
The assignment is driven by a \emph{stress function} which penalizes for the average distortion created by the embedding.
The different types of MDSs, such as \emph{Classical MDS}, and \emph{Sammon Mappings}, differ in the stress function driving the embedding.

For more on MDS see Section 14.8 in \cite{hastie_elements_2003} or \cite{borg_modern_2005}.


\paragraph{Mathematics of MDS}
We start with either a dissimilarity network $\dissimilaritys=(\dissimilarity_{i,j})$, or a similarity network $\similaritys=(\similarity_{i,j})$.
Similarities can be thought of as correlations, and dissimilarities as distances (which are indeed the typical measures in use).
Define $z_i \in \reals^\rank$ the location of point $i$ in the target linear space of rank $\rank$. 
The $z_i$'s are set to minimize some penalty for geometric deformation called the \emph{stress function}.
Typical stress functions include:
\begin{description}

\item[Classical MDS] Using the centred inner product (i.e. empirical covariance) as the similarity measure and minimizes the squared distortion:
$\similarity_{i,j}:= \scalar{x_i-\bar x}{x_j-\bar{x}}$ and the new location are given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mds_classical}
	 \argmin{z_1,\dots,z_n}{\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} (\similarity_{i,j}-\scalar{z_i-\bar z}{z_j-\bar{z}} )^2}.
\end{align}

\item[Least Squares] Also known as \emph{Kruskal-Shepard}. Also minimizes the squared distortion. 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mds_stress}
	 \argmin{z_1,\dots,z_n}{\sum_{i \neq j} (\dissimilarity_{i,j}-\norm{z_i-z_j} )^2}.
\end{align}

\item[Sammon Mapping] Also known as \emph{Sammon's stress}, aims at minimizing the \emph{proportion} of distortion:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mds_sammon}
	 \argmin{z_1,\dots,z_n}{\sum_{i \neq j} \frac{(\dissimilarity_{i,j}-\norm{z_i-z_j} )^2}{\dissimilarity_{i,j}}}.
\end{align}

\end{description}


\begin{remark}[Classical and Least Squares MDS]
Although they both minimize the squared distortion, working with $\similaritys$ or $\dissimilaritys$ lead to different solutions. 
In particular, Classical is a linear embedding while Stress is not. 
\end{remark}




\subsection{Local MDS}
\label{sec:localMDS}
Local MDS is motivated by the observation that if the data does not lay in a globally convex subspace, then global distances are a very distorted measure, whereas geodesic distances should be used instead. 
Their solution is to compute $\dissimilaritys$ using only local distances, and then calling upon MDS.

\begin{remark}[The Non-Linearity of Local MDS]
\label{remark:linearity_of_localMDS}
Local MDS is typically considered a non-linear-space embedding, thus belonging to Section \ref{sec:dim_reduce_nonlinear}.
I currently do not think is the case, as it is presented as a linear space embedding.
Maybe Remark \ref{remark:nldr} can explain the confusion in terminology.
\end{remark}



\subsection{Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap)}
\label{sec:isomap}

Isomap, also known as \emph{principal coordinate analysis}, is another method intimately related to MDS(\S\ref{sec:mds}).\marginnote{Principal Coordinate Analysis}

Isomap follows the same motivation as Local MDS (\S\ref{sec:localMDS}), but with a different algorithm to compute the dissimilarity matrix $\dissimilaritys$.

\begin{remark}[The Non-Linearity of Isomap]
Just like Local MDS, Isomap is typically considered a non-linear-space embedding (see Remark \ref{remark:linearity_of_localMDS}).
I currently do not think is the case.
\end{remark}



\subsection{Random Projections}
\label{sec:random_projections}

What if instead of optimizing a linear embedding of the features with respect to some criterion, such as PCA (\S\ref{sec:pca}), or FA (\S\ref{sec:factor_analysis}), we simply apply a random linear mapping $W X$. How bad will the distances between the observations be distorted? 
It turns out that not too much!
The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma \citep{johnson_extensions_1984} quantifies this distortion, essentially implying that we may reduce the dimension of our data in a very \naive manner, while still conserving pair-wise similarities $\similaritys$ between observations.

\section{Non-Linear-Space Embeddings}
\label{sec:dim_reduce_nonlinear}


Section \ref{sec:dim_reduce_linear} deals with representing the data in a \emph{linear} sub space $\manifold$. They all aim at finding a basis which efficiently represents that data, with respect to some target function. 
In this section, we allow $\manifold$ to be non-linear. 
We will thus no longer be able to represent the data by its coordinates in some basis.


\begin{remark}[Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction]
\label{remark:nldr}
	Do not let the title of this section be confused with the term Non-Linear Dimensionality-Reduction (NLDR).
	NLDR deals with the nature of the \emph{embedding} operation, and not with the structure of the target manifold $\manifold$ (see also Remark \ref{remark:linear}).\marginnote{NLDR}
	This section deals with embeddings into a non-linear subspace, regardless of the nature of the embedding operator.
	Cases of non-linear embeddings (NLDR) into a \emph{linear} manifolds $\manifold$ belong in Section~\ref{sec:dim_reduce_linear}.
\end{remark}




\subsection{Kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA)}
\label{sec:kpca}

Back to the motivating example from the PCA section (\S\ref{sec:pca}): assume we want to construct a ``bigness'' score, that best separates between individuals, but we no longer constrain it to be a linear function of the height and weight.
Recalling that the best discrimination between observations means maximizing the variance of the \emph{scores} given to individuals, we could try to find the best separating score $g(x)$ by solving 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:kpca_wrong}
	\argmax{g}{\covn{g(X)}}
\end{align}
where $g(x)$ maps an individual's features to a score in $\manifold$.

Alas, just like in the supervised learning problem, without any constraints on $\manifold$, thus on $g$, we might overfit \andor not be able to compute $g$ as optimization is done in a infinite dimensional space. 
We thus have two matters to attend:
(i) We need to constrain $g(x)$ so that it does not overfit.
(ii) We need the problem to be computable.
This is precisely the goal of kPCA. 

We have already encountered a similar problem with Smoothing Splines (\S\ref{sec:smoothing_splines}). It is thus not surprising that the solution has the same form. 
Namely, if we choose the right $g$'s, the solution of Eq.(\ref{eq:kpca_wrong}) takes a very simple form. 
The classes of such $g$'s are known as Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). 
They are discussed in Appendix~\ref{apx:rkhs}.

\subsection{Information Bottleneck}
[TODO]

%The \emph{information bottleneck} is an information theoretic framework, due to \cite{tishby_information_1999}, that generalizes the idea of dimensionality reduction and data compression.
%It is a general statement of the problem of maximal compression of $X$, while preserving as much of the information in $X$ as possible.
%To state the general problem we require some definitions from information theory.
%
%\begin{definition}[Entropy]
%The entropy of a random variable $\x$ is defined as the expected negative log density of $\x$: 
%$$\expect{-\log \pdf(\x)}.$$
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Mutual Information]
%The mutual information between two random variable $\x$ and $\y$ is defined as : 
%$$\expect{\log \frac{\pdf(\x,\y)}{\pdf(\x) \pdf(\y)}}.$$
%\end{definition}
%
%Informally speaking, the entropy is a measure of the variability of a distribution, and the mutual information is a measure of deviation from independence, i.e., captures the amount of information $\x$ carries on $\y$, and vice-versa.
%With this intuition, and denoting the compression of $x$ by $y=g(x)$, we may define the compression problem as:
%\begin{align}
%	\argmin{g}{arg2}

%%%%%%%%% Generative Models %%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Latent Space Generative Models}
\label{sec:latent_space}

We have already met generative models for supervised learning (\S\ref{sec:generative}), and for unsupervised learning (\S\ref{sec:density_estimation}).
We now discuss a class of generative models, that can be seen as a dimensionality device. 
The following models and methods assume that the data generating process is governed by some low dimensional unobservable \emph{state}, also known as \emph{latent variable}, or \emph{hidden variable}.
The latent variables define a \emph{state}. This is why these models are also known as \emph{state space} models. A term coined by \citet{kalman_contributions_1960}.\marginnote{State-Space Models}

This specification allows us to:
(i) \emph{Interpret} the data generating process via its states. 
(ii) \emph{Formulate} the density estimation problem as a low dimensional problem, we can actually hope to solve, even when the data itself is very high dimensional.

The fundamental idea is that while the data generating distribution may have a complicated form, when we condition on the unobserved variable, the distribution greatly simplifies.

\subsection{Factor Analysis (FA)}
\label{sec:factor_analysis}

Factor Analysis is solved very similarly to PCA (\S\ref{sec:pca}), so that the two are often confused. 
FA, however, stems from a rather different motivation than PCA.
PCA is motivated by finding variable combinations (scores) with most variance. 
FA is a generative method, aimed at finding uncorrelated latent attributes. 

In FA we assume that the observed $X$'s depend linearly on a set of $\rank$ independent latent (i.e. unobservable) attributes we denote with $\latent$.
The generative model is thus
\begin{align}
\label{eq:factor}
	X=\loadings \latent+\varepsilon
\end{align}
Assuming a generative distribution on $\latent$ and $\varepsilon$, we may try to estimate $\loadings \latent$ by maximum likelihood.
Recovering the particular latent attributes $\latent$ from $\estim{\loadings\latent}$ is still impossible as there are infinitely many such solutions. To see this, consider an orthogonal \emph{rotation} matrix $\rotation$ ($\rotation' \rotation=I$). For each such $\rotation$: $ \loadings \latent=\loadings \rotation' \rotation \latent = \loadings^* \latent^*$.

The choice of $\rotation$ changes the interpretation of the latent attributes. This is why many researchers find FA an unsatisfactory inference tool.

\begin{remark}[Identifiability in PCA]
	The non-uniqueness (non-identifiability) of the FA solution under variable rotation is never mentioned in the PCA context. Why is this?
	This is because the methods have different purposes. 
	Generative latent variables, as in FA, are only defined up to rotations. They are thus not unique. 
	Combinations with maximal variance, as in PCA, are unique. There is no room for rotations.
\end{remark}



\paragraph{FA Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Factors}: The unobserved attributes $\latent$. Not to be confused with the \emph{principal components} in the context of PCA.
\item \textbf{Loadings}: The $\loadings$ matrix; the contribution of each attribute to the observed $X$.
\item \textbf{Rotation}: An orthogonal re-combination of the latent attributes $\latent$ and loadings, which changes the interpretation of the result.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Independent Component Analysis (ICA)}
\label{sec:ica}

ICA is a family of latent space models as it assumes data is generated as some function of the latent variables $\latent$. 
In many cases this function is assumed to be linear in $\latent$ so that ICA is compared, if not confused, with PCA or FA. 

The fundamental idea of ICA is that $\latent$ has a joint distribution of \emph{independent} variables. 
This is a stronger assumption that the typical FA assumption where the distribution of $\latent$ is merely assumed to be uncorrelated. 
This independence assumption solves the the non-uniquness of the latent attributes in FA (\S\ref{sec:factor_analysis}).

Two assumptions distinguish ICA from FA, allowing the identification of $\latent$: 
(i) The latent variables are \textbf{not} Gaussian distributed.
(ii) The latent variables are statistically \emph{independent}.

Being a generative model, estimation of $\latent$ can then be done using maximum likelihood, or an information theoretic criterion called \emph{infomax}.\marginnote{Infomax}



ICA is a popular technique in signal processing, where $\latent$ is actually the signal (e.g. sound) produced by several different sources. 
Recovering $\latent$ is thus recovering the original signals mixing in the recorded $X$. This is known as \emph{blind source separation}.\marginnote{Blind Source Seperation}


\begin{remark}[ICA and FA]
The solutions to the (linear) ICA problem can ultimately be seen as a solution to the FA problem with a particular rotation $\rotation$ implied by the independence assumption.
Put differently, the formulation of the (linear) ICA problem, implies a unique rotation. 
\end{remark}

\section{Random Graph Models}
\label{sec:random_graphs}

There are several occasions in which our date does not consist of the classical features $X$, but rather directly given as a similarity (disimilarity) graph. This can happen when the data itself is a graph, such as social networks, communication networks, protein interactions networks, etc. It may also be the case that the original data is indeed given as features, which was used to compute a similarity (disimilarity) graph. Indeed, We have already seen that for the purpose of clustering, we only need some proximity graph between observations, and not the whole features. 

Random Graphs are a class of \emph{generative models}, but unlike other generative methods, the model does not specify a distribution over the features, but rather a distribution over the proximity measures.
For this, it is  intimately related to \emph{random graph} and \emph{random matrix} theory.

For a review of random graph models see \cite{goldenberg_survey_2010}.
